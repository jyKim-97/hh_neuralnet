	'w' is updated in here

- data: main simulation result 
! collected data_old and data_wextend 

- data_wextend: simulation result with extended w
! w is changed: w=1 (no projection from fast to slow) / w=-1 (no projection from slow to fast)

- data_old: previous dataset with w=0.1,...,1

- data_w10: opposite direction
-> p_ratio_set < 0 = projection ratio |p| from slow to fast

- data_prel: use relative asymmetric ratio, x
-> p_ratio_slow = x   (assym from slow to fast)
-> p_ratio_fast = 1-x (assym from fast to slow)

# NEED to CHECK
- for rank=0/1, need to make "chi" as nan for total(0) populations, 24-48, recommend to remove the points with obj.summary > 1
- for rank=0.5, currently itr=3, but elongated to 9 to fit with rank=0/1 case
